//! A link written in a note, as a word processor has one written: a small plate under the words it is made of (or the
//! caret), in the look of the note's menus, with a field for the words it shows and one for where it goes. Its words
//! written as Markdown writes a link (see `notes::edit::put_link`) once both are filled in, in place of what was chosen,
//! or of the link that was there (edited). Its fields are text services' boxes of their own (see `Editor::line`), as a
//! table's cell written in is: the keys, the input method's words and the pointer's theirs while it is up.
